# Transformer Models for Seismic Facies Segmentation

This repository contains the configuration files used in the experiments conducted for the Master's thesis _"An Evaluation of Transformer Models for Seismic Facies Segmentation"_ by Gabriel Borges Gutierrez, defended at the Institute of Computing, University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in 2025.

## 📄 Thesis Summary

The thesis investigates the use of Transformer-based architectures for seismic facies segmentation, comparing them against strong CNN-based baselines under identical training conditions. Five models were evaluated:

- CNN-based:
  - DeepLab V3
  - DeepLab V3+

- Transformer-based:
  - SegFormer
  - Segmenter
  - SETR-PUP

All models were trained on the F3 and Seam AI datasets using the [MMsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) framework. Additionally, a hyperparameter optimization pipeline was applied to the best-performing model (SETR-PUP), using the author's in-house framework.


## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- MMCV
- MMsegmentation
- CUDA 11.3+
